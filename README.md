CLI Spotify playlist shuffler 

I claim without proof that Spotify's shuffle feature is not a truly random shuffle. It appears that metrics like listen history and song popularity affect what will be played next. This script attempts to address the problem by extracting, shuffling, then reinserting songs of a playlist or Liked Songs.

This was created with the Spotify Web API wrapper for GO -> https://github.com/zmb3/spotify
